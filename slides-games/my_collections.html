        <h2 class="about"> About: This game is a fictional simulator that lets you try out common jobs. There are 4 base levels, beginner, intermediate, <br> advanced, and expert. Each have 5 jobs in them based on their skill level. Play along to test your skills and find what Job Simulator has to offer for you. </h2>
        <h3 style="color:red;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">⚠️ Unfortunatly, after the new Google Slides update, Job Simulator does not work anymore. Fortunatly, I've found a way to fix this. Firstly, you can tell if you have the update by noticing if there is the border of a black box whenever you click a link (button). If you do, the game will only work if you play it right after refreshing your screen. So, refresh this page then immediately start playing this. The black border will show up for the first slide, but it won't for any other slides. </h3>

The movie is about the search for the cookie and what clues and hints lead them to the culprit. Unfortunatly, this isn't finished and will most likely never be. I moved on to more interactive games rather than stories, but this will still remain because of all the effort I once put into this. </h2>
